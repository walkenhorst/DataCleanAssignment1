###This repository was set up for the 1st assignment of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" subject 
###as part of the Data Science specialisation on Coursera.

### Details of the run_analysis.r script
The run_analysis.r script uses the dataset found at the following web site:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
This script formats the above referenced dataset to be intuitive, tidy and easy to use
by doing the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the
average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
